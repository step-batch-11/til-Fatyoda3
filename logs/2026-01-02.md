# Today I Learned

Write **1–3 concrete things** you understood better today.

- What _clicked_ today?
- I still have holes in my knowledge like I know some of the hows about how to
  do certain things but I don't have clarity
- I have a lot to do Abhay, Himanshu, Sagnik, Deepak, Adithyan Jeniffer, Amisha
  they all are making cool stuff I must make something myself
- socializing, showcasing things can help me improve my stuff

---

- What changed in your understanding?
- I do not know
- P5 js is a better way to visualize code
- I have a lot to do

---

- What would you explain differently now?
- I would explain myself or my ideas really carefully
- I would explain my code or read and explain code a lot more patiently

---

# Still Confusing

List **up to 3 things** that are still unclear.

- What almost makes sense but doesn’t fully? I still find the 2d array plotting
  a little confusing as `[row, column]` or `[i,j]` are kind of interchanged
  `Y <-> X`

---

- What would you like to see one more example of?
- everything if possible.

---

- What feels fragile in your understanding?
- I don't get parsing logic sometimes
- I find int-code computer a little hard to do

---

# Questions to Chase

Write **2–5 questions** worth pursuing later.

- how to parse `PNG` ?
- how to parse `JSON` ?
- what are quad tree ?
- what are L system ?
- what causes me to `ask things` that I know I might not get a positive answer
  for ?

---

Rules:

- Questions must be specific
- Avoid yes/no questions

- “Why does X behave differently when Y?”
- “What breaks if I remove Z?”
- “How does this scale / fail / degrade?”

---

# Tiny Experiments (Optional)

- a really simple parser
- give vectors another read
- implement turtle

Small things you want to try tomorrow or later.

- A REPL experiment
- A minimal snippet
- A variation of today’s code

---
